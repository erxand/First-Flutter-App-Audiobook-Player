# Overview

I made this app to learn how to use Flutter and Dart, before this app I hadn't ever made a mobile app.
This app is intended to be an audiobook player, that is its basic function.
As time goes on and I learn more I intend to add more features, but the primary goal of this project was just to make a funcitonal mobile app.

{Provide a description of your app.  Describe how to use the app.}

{Provide a link to your YouTube demonstration.  It should be a 4-5 minute demo of the app running and a walkthrough of the code.}

# Development Environment

This app was made in the Dart language using the Flutter SDK, all development was done in Android Studio.

{Describe the programming any libraries that you used.}

Flutter uses plugins to import useful features that other people have already built, I used a few in this project.
Here are some that I either used or learned from while attempting to use.

* [audioplayers](pub.dev/packages/audioplayers)
    * Enables your app to play mp3 files from local storage.
* [audio_service](pub.dev/packages/audio_service)
    * Enables the audio being played by your app to be controlled from the notification bar, lock screen, etc.

    * This was outdated and not fully functional, which was unfortunate because it did almost everything I needed. More learning came from not being able to use it.
* [Scaffold Widgets](https://medium.flutterdevs.com/know-your-widgets-scaffold-in-flutter-292b8bc1281)
    * This gives an overview of the different possible components of the scaffold widget.
* [Flutter Icons](https://fonts.google.com/icons?selected=Material+Icons&icon.query=play)
    * These are all the icons automatically included in Flutter, here you can see what they look like, search through them, and see how Flutter names them.
