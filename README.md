# Overview

I made this app to learn how to use Flutter and Dart, before this app I hadn't ever made a mobile app.
This app is intended to be an audiobook player, that is its basic function.
As time goes on and I learn more I intend to add more features, but the primary goal of this project was just to make a functional mobile app.

* One of the major things I realized I didn't know until it was a little too late was how to use git with Android Studio, I ended up just uploading the essential files without connecting them through git.

# Development Environment

This app was made in the Dart language using the Flutter SDK, all development was done in Android Studio.

Flutter uses plugins to import useful features that other people have already built, I used a few in this project.
Here are some that I either used or learned from while attempting to use.

* [audioplayers](pub.dev/packages/audioplayers)
    * Enables your app to play mp3 files from local storage.
* [audio_service](pub.dev/packages/audio_service)
    * Enables the audio being played by your app to be controlled from the notification bar, lock screen, etc.
  
# Useful Websites

These sites will give you all the knowledge I found in the making of this app, for the most part at least.

    * This was outdated and not fully functional, which was unfortunate because it did almost everything I needed. More learning came from not being able to use it.
* [Scaffold Widgets](https://medium.flutterdevs.com/know-your-widgets-scaffold-in-flutter-292b8bc1281)
    * This gives an overview of the different possible components of the scaffold widget.
* [Flutter Icons](https://fonts.google.com/icons?selected=Material+Icons&icon.query=play)
    * These are all the icons automatically included in Flutter, here you can see what they look like, search through them, and see how Flutter names them.


# Future Work

* Find different plugin to use
* Spend more time learning Dart syntax
* Spend more time learning Flutter structure
